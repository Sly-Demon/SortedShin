These creatures are much like clouds in their true form, incorporeal so that they can’t interact with physical objects. They can change the colors of their clouds down to exquisite detail, and create sounds, giving them the title ‘living illusions’. Mischievous and playful, but overall docile creatures, they are sometimes known to bond with humanoids they find entertaining. They can shrink down to the size of a bunny or expand to the size of a house. They’re weak to wind magic and mana construct attacks in their ‘area’, being split into too many parts before they can heal kills them, dispersing their cloud back into mist. They can be healed by feeding them mana, particularly air crystals.",

The sound varies depending on the size and shape of the crystal along with the force of the impact, with larger crystals producing deeper notes and smaller ones producing higher-pitched sounds. Echo Crystal is highly valued by musicians and sound crafters, who use it to create musical instruments and audio equipment. The mining and harvesting of Echo Crystal is a delicate process, as the crystals are easily damaged by excessive vibrations or rough handling. As a result, Echo Crystal is a rare and expensive mineral.",

This process is only possible on the corrupted land due to its unique mana characteristics. They are very potent with shadow and earth mana. The prisms practically melt in base liquids, but acidic liquids do not seem to have any effect to Glythite. It is unknown why Glythite forms into prisms, but they are often used in the creation of assassin weapons or in laboratories to handle dangerous liquids.",

It is believed to be iron, but with a huge difference: instead of being made naturally by heat and pressure, it is made by cold instead of heat. This is possible by a possible fusion between mana and the cold, the result being a more durable variation of iron, when in contact with anything, it freezes the object almost instantly. Strangely, fabric is immune to the freezing effect.",

Forming in crystaline structures, when the pink part of this crystal is pressed against organic materials it leaves markings similar to ink from a pen. This creates essentially “invisible mana ink”, invisible to the eye but readable through magic by trained individuals. Due to being often used to send illegal messages between crime syndicates, Yeortzie is illegal in the major clans but independent villages allow them freely. The pink of a crystal will progressively turn purple then black, where it will stop exuding the written mana ink and be depleted.",

The user can create an almost infinite number as long as they have the mana and mass to sustain it, as each insect they create takes away from their mass. The user will also not die as long as one of the insects remains. Instead, their body will reform from the insect but, in turn, lose all their strength, abilities, and capabilities aside from the fruit itself.",
