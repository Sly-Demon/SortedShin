    "Description": "A palm-sized fruit that grows on large vines in areas where the sun shines brightly and water is nearby. Sundew fruit gives off a glow when cut, which isn't very strong but can light a small area. Upon consumption, the consumer will begin to brightly glow in all directions in a 10 meter range. This glow is 3000 lumens and strong enough to blind anyone unprepared nearby, though the consumer isn't affected by it. The juice of this fruit can have the same effect, and it's described as having a refreshing, sweet taste.",

Forming in crystaline structures, when the pink part of this crystal is pressed against organic materials it leaves markings similar to ink from a pen. This creates essentially “invisible mana ink”, invisible to the eye but readable through magic by trained individuals. Due to being often used to send illegal messages between crime syndicates, Yeortzie is illegal in the major clans but independent villages allow them freely. The pink of a crystal will progressively turn purple then black, where it will stop exuding the written mana ink and be depleted.",
