https://www.shinseina.world/post/r-albassium,unknown,R - Albassium,,,,,"Albassium is a rare mineral known for its light-absorbing surface, appearing so dark that it reflects no light whatsoever, even under direct illumination. Found deep underground and in the deep seas, it is favored for its ability to render armor and equipment nearly invisible in low-light environments. When forged into gear, it grants a natural camouflage effect in shadowed areas, though its effectiveness fades in light. Albassium’s density also makes it excellent for reinforcing light armor without compromising silence or mobility.",

It is highly sought after by warriors as it is the perfect material for crafting armor and weaponry and practically anything else. Blankium does come with its own set of difficulties when put to use such as reducing the effectiveness of the enchantments imbued on the item it was used to make as it is less conductive to mana than other ores. Additionally it is extremely difficult to process requiring extreme temperatures to smelt and even greater effort to shape properly making intricate projects almost impossible for it to be used for.,

It is formed through the slow crystallization of minerals in underwater caverns, and its unique coloration is believed to be due to the absorption of pure, condensed Water Mana within it, which allows it to take the form it has. Aqualight Quartz is quite durable, making it useful in construction and jewelery-making, and it is also believed to have magical properties related to storms and tsunamis. It is quite liked by water-based races, and many wear jewelery made from it. Connections have been drawn to it and Starlight Quartz, but the Guild and many clan nobles refuse to acknowledge this.",
