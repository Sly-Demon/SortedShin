📌 **Name:** Yeortzie
📍 **Region:** 
💰 **Cost:** 
⚗️ **Preparation:** 
📝 **Description:** Updated: Feb 9, 2023
Color: Pink fading to purple

Mineral Location: Anywhere

Mineral Rarity: Uncommon

Moh Hardness Ranking: 3.5

Melting Point: 1050°C

Solubility: Minorly Soluble

Market Value: Illegal; 5 silver per pound

Description: A mineral that is used for writing. Forming in crystaline structures, when the pink part of this crystal is pressed against organic materials it leaves markings similar to ink from a pen. This creates essentially “invisible mana ink”, invisible to the eye but readable through magic by trained individuals. Due to being often used to send illegal messages between crime syndicates, Yeortzie is illegal in the major clans but independent villages allow them freely. The pink of a crystal will progressively turn purple then black, where it will stop exuding the written mana ink and be depleted.

⚗️ **Preparation:** Eating
📝 **Description:** Upon taking one bit from the fruit, the rest of the fruit vanishes, and the user gains a new ability; this makes it so the user can not gain an ability from another fruit of a similar nature and is unable to touch purified water. This fruit grants the user the ability to turn their body into a hive of small holes, much like a bee nest, and from these holes, the user is able to create swarms of insects, be it common insects such as bees, ants, flies, and more, or lower ranked fauna insects as long as they have a queen of them. The user can create an almost infinite number as long as they have the mana and mass to sustain it, as each insect they create takes away from their mass. The user will also not die as long as one of the insects remains. Instead, their body will reform from the insect but, in turn, lose all their strength, abilities, and capabilities aside from the fruit itself.
