Description: Entirely female, these are often used by Moon Elves as family protectors. Their elegant feathers and noble stature make them an exotic pet to collect or hunt. They are capable of mating with Seks and usually consist of 2 or 3 in a pack. Their above animal intelligence makes them more like companions than pets to those who treat them as such. They will die if they do not absorb moon energy for several days. Unlike Seks, they are nocturnal and will often stay in dark or barely lit places.",

Its shell is tough and lined with dark mana, causing anything it comes into contact with to decay rapidly. These beetles are often found near Black Veins, where they burrow into the soil and lay in wait for unsuspecting prey. They are scavengers by nature, feeding on the remnants of fallen creatures.",
https://www.shinseina.world/post/d-mossback-sloth,unknown,D - Mossback Sloth,,Jungle and Swamp,,,"The Mossback Sloth is a slow-moving sloth-like creature that walks on all fours with the size of a human on average. It is called Mossback Sloth due to the moss and other plants that grow on its back and body as it moves so slowly, without care to clean them off. This creature also has regenerative properties, allowing the sloth to heal minor injuries over time by absorbing sunlight and water much like moss. Though it moves slowly, the Mossback Sloth is incredibly adept at blending into its surroundings, making it difficult to spot and hiding from predators if it doesn't want to be found. It is completely non-hostile and feeds primarily on plants, very rarely at that as they can go months without needing food.",

Region: Forests and Corrupted Swamp  

Description: These creatures have isolated themselves within dense forestry. They have the appetite of a camel, able to save food and go without eating for long periods, while being the size of a giraffe. They're surprisingly nonviolent, but still aren't the least bit friendly. Those born in the corrupted swamp are able to breathe fire and have been seen doing so to keep their eggs warm while they're away. They give birth to eggs, unlike giraffes.",
