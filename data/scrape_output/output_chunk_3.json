    "Description": "The Shocktopus is a fearsome marine predator with a unique blend of agility and electrical abilities. It has eight long, flexible tentacles that ripple with electricity, and when they make contact with something they can send out a powerful burst of electricity to fry the target. The creature's body is slim and covered in tough, rubbery skin that provides resistance against physical attacks as well as magic. When threatened or hunting, the Shocktopus can unleash a burst of electricity from specialized cells in its tentacles, stunning or paralyzing its prey so that it is easier to hunt; strong enough bursts can even kill the target. Despite its fearsome abilities, the Shocktopus is a rare sight, dwelling in the deep ocean trenches and occasionally venturing into coastal caves. It is a solitary creature, known for its intelligence and cunning, often outwitting even the most experienced hunters.",
