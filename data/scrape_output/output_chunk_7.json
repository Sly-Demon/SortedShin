This process is only possible on the corrupted land due to its unique mana characteristics. They are very potent with shadow and earth mana. The prisms practically melt in base liquids, but acidic liquids do not seem to have any effect to Glythite. It is unknown why Glythite forms into prisms, but they are often used in the creation of assassin weapons or in laboratories to handle dangerous liquids.",

It is believed to be iron, but with a huge difference: instead of being made naturally by heat and pressure, it is made by cold instead of heat. This is possible by a possible fusion between mana and the cold, the result being a more durable variation of iron, when in contact with anything, it freezes the object almost instantly. Strangely, fabric is immune to the freezing effect.",
