These creatures are much like clouds in their true form, incorporeal so that they can’t interact with physical objects. They can change the colors of their clouds down to exquisite detail, and create sounds, giving them the title ‘living illusions’. Mischievous and playful, but overall docile creatures, they are sometimes known to bond with humanoids they find entertaining. They can shrink down to the size of a bunny or expand to the size of a house. They’re weak to wind magic and mana construct attacks in their ‘area’, being split into too many parts before they can heal kills them, dispersing their cloud back into mist. They can be healed by feeding them mana, particularly air crystals.",

    "Description": "Echo Crystal is a rare mineral that forms in caves and underground chambers where sound is often bouncing off the walls and hitting the crystal repeatedly. Its unique property is its ability to emit a musical sound when struck or hit. The sound varies depending on the size and shape of the crystal along with the force of the impact, with larger crystals producing deeper notes and smaller ones producing higher-pitched sounds. Echo Crystal is highly valued by musicians and sound crafters, who use it to create musical instruments and audio equipment. The mining and harvesting of Echo Crystal is a delicate process, as the crystals are easily damaged by excessive vibrations or rough handling. As a result, Echo Crystal is a rare and expensive mineral.",

    "Description": "The Tranquil Spirit is a somewhat translucent creature that looks like a bug with wings and many hands, it can vary in size being able to grow as big as someone's palm. It is completely friendly in nature and doesn't even hurt things to eat, as they survive on mana, in fact they are so friendly that they release an aura around them that makes others feel comfortable.
