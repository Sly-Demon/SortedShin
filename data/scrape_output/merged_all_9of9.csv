Preparation: Multi-Functional Fruit

Cost: 1 silver per star

Description: A star fruit that flows with magical abundance. The exterior of this fruit is similar to an orange, while the yellow interior resembles the texture of a plum. The juices of this fruit are squeezed out and mulched to make Ale in Chusei, where it’s only been found to grow in. Any attempt to grow this fruit outside of Chusei has been found futile, despite resembling the same atmospheric conditions as Chusei. Because of this, Chusei has made a monopoly on the production of Fipoint which has an energizing, smooth taste  similar to what can only be described as a “Banana-Plum”. While it’s not illegal outside of Chusei, there are mixed views on the fruit due to those who grow it, as Chusei is a primarily rogue village.",,,,,

Description: A mineral that is used for writing. Forming in crystaline structures, when the pink part of this crystal is pressed against organic materials it leaves markings similar to ink from a pen. This creates essentially “invisible mana ink”, invisible to the eye but readable through magic by trained individuals. Due to being often used to send illegal messages between crime syndicates, Yeortzie is illegal in the major clans but independent villages allow them freely. The pink of a crystal will progressively turn purple then black, where it will stop exuding the written mana ink and be depleted.",

The user can create an almost infinite number as long as they have the mana and mass to sustain it, as each insect they create takes away from their mass. The user will also not die as long as one of the insects remains.
