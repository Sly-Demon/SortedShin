When a Dorbog consumes enough creatures and their flesh, they undergo a transformation, growing in strength, size, and intelligence. Dorbog Kings are approximate twice the size of an average human, possessing superior intelligence compared to regular Dorbogs.
Due to their increased intelligence and physical capabilities, Dorbog Kings naturally assume leadership roles. They have a strong desire to rule, often gathering tribes of Dorbogs in their vicinity to form large tribes or even kingdoms, consisting of thousands of members. These kingdoms may include subordinate Mages and Alphas under their rule.
Encountering a Dorbog King is exceedingly rare, as very few have been noted to exist. Many of them have been killed before they had the opportunity to establish a Dorbog Kingdom. The combination of their exceptional attributes, intelligence, and leadership qualities makes Dorbog Kings a formidable and legendary presence within the swamps and seaside regions.

They typically stand at the size of a human and hold significant influence within their tribes, often leading alongside Alphas. Unlike regular Dorbogs, they do not interbreed within their own tribe but seek out other Mages to maintain the purity of their bloodline.
Dorbog Mages are rare, and most tribes do not have a Mage among their members due to their low birthrate. Only tribes numbering in the thousands would be privileged to possess a Mage. These Mages include greater physical strength and size compared to regular Dorbogs, allowing them to fulfill the roles of both Mages and, on occasion, hunters. Gender distinctions do not apply to Dorbog Mages.
Equipped with a wooden staff decorated with animal bones, Dorbog Mages have honed their mana-channeling abilities. They can utilize Spells at a D Rank level, making them formidable magical practitioners. The rugged, leather-like skin of the Dorbog Mages offers them additional protection in combat.

The pink of a crystal will progressively turn purple then black, where it will stop exuding the written mana ink and be depleted.
