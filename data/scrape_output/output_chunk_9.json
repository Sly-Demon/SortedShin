    "Description": "A palm-sized fruit that grows on large vines in areas where the sun shines brightly and water is nearby. Sundew fruit gives off a glow when cut, which isn't very strong but can light a small area. Upon consumption, the consumer will begin to brightly glow in all directions in a 10 meter range. This glow is 3000 lumens and strong enough to blind anyone unprepared nearby, though the consumer isn't affected by it. The juice of this fruit can have the same effect, and it's described as having a refreshing, sweet taste.",
